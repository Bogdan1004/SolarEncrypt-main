# Solarencrypt

Solar-powered device to serve as a  Private Cloud Server, VPN, and communication medium in areas with no GSM signal using the signal transmitted over radio waves. I used 4 raspberry-pi to make a cluster with K3s so that service to be redundant + one more RPI for solar panel that track the solar position for best power gain.
